Branch Management:
We can create many branches in our repository and work in them. We also need to manage them. So let’s see few commands for managing branches in Git:

To see all the branches you have created you will need to use this command : “git branch” and the current branch will have “*” in front of the branch.
To see Branches and that branch’s last commit along with it’s message type “git branch -v” and press enter.
If you want to see which branches were merged then use “git branch --merged” and those that were not merged use “git branch --unmerged”.
To delete a branch we need to use “git branch -d branchname”. Note that this command will fail if the branch we are deleting has not merged to the main branch. To tackle this error we will use “git branch -D branchname”, it will delete the branch even if it's not even merged yet.
 

So this is it. I hope this has cleared your doubts. Thank you for watching.
